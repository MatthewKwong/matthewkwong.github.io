          <h1>Spotify Rooms</h1>
          <h2>June 28 - July 16, 2019</h2>
          <p>To solve the reocurring problem my friends and I have of
            playing music in the car, I decided to make a prototype feature I
            would want introduced into the Spotify mobile application called Rooms.
            Rooms would create a new, fast way of sharing music for any occassion,
            whether that be in the car or at a party.
            <br>
            Through this project, I learned Sketch, InvisionApp, and how to make
            gifs in Photoshop.
            <br>
            Site:
            <b><a href = "../spotify-rooms">www.matthewkwong.com/spotify-rooms</a></b>
            <br>
            Additionally, check out the article I wrote on <b><a href = "https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:6558843952450142208/">LinkedIn</a></b>
          </p>

      <h1>Interactive Prototype</h1>
      <iframe style="transform: scale(0.75)" width="438" height="930" src="//invis.io/58SN7SVMX4N" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>


      <h1>Wireframes</h1>
      <p>It was important that the new feature was clean and simple in order to
        create a simple and easy way for users to use. During the design process
        I kept in mind that often the best applications require the least amount
         of steps to use.</p>
         <p>
           To see a full working prototype of the application check it out at

         </p>


        <h2>Start Menu</h2>
        <p>I've included the Rooms tab next to the already existing Music and Podcasts
        tabs, making it accessible and easy to locate. Once opening the Rooms screen,
      users are introduced to 2 options, join and create. </p>

          <img src = "images/spotify-rooms/2rooms.png" alt = "rooms diagram">
        </div>

        <h2>Driver Lobby Menu</h2>
        <p>Once the driver has created a new room, passengers will enter the 4 digit
          generated code to join. Passengers can then add songs to the play queue by clicking the
          "Add Songs" button where they will be introduced to the same song search
          menu they're familiar on the Spotify application.</p>

        <h2>Passenger Menu</h2>
        <p>Once the driver has created a new room, passengers will enter the 4 digit
            generated code to join. Passengers can then add songs to the play queue by clicking the
            "Add Songs" button where they will be introduced to the same song search
            menu they're familiar on the Spotify application.</p>

          <img src = "images/spotify-rooms/12search2.png" alt = "search image 2">
        </div>


        <h2>Vote to Remove Songs</h2>
        <p>By introducing a vote kicking functionality unwanted songs
        will be removed with a 2/3 majority vote.</p>
        <div class = "diagrams-wrapper">
          <img src = "images/spotify-rooms/13vote1.png" alt = "passenger queue">

          <img src = "images/spotify-rooms/16vote4.png" alt = "vote kicking diagram 3">
        </div>



        <h2>Exit</h2>
        <p>Instead of making a complex exit system, with a tap of a
          button user's will return to the default starting screen where they
           will have the option to join or create new room.</p>
